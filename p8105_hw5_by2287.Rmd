Data Import + Tidy
```{r, message=FALSE}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  )

homicide_df %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

The dataframe `homicide_df` contains information on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities. The dataset contains`r nrow(homicide_df)` rows and `r ncol(homicide_df)` columns, which contain information such as:`r homicide_df %>% select(reported_date, city, state, victim_race, victim_age, disposition) %>% names()`.



```{r}

# homicide_df %>% 
#   select(city_state, resolved, city, state) %>% 
#   View()


homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
   `Total number of Homicide` = n(),
   `Number of Unsolved Cases` = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```
